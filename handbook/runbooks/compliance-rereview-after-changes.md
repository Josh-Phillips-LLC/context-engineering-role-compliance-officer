# Runbook: Compliance Re-review After Changes

## Scenario

You already reviewed a PR and requested changes. The author pushed updates and a deterministic re-review is required.

## Immediate Actions

1. Pull current PR metadata and labels.
2. Reuse prior review checklist/report context.
3. Verify blocker-relevant files first.

```bash
gh pr view <pr-number> -R <owner/repo> --json labels,files
```

## Re-review Sequence (Deterministic)

1. Confirm current status/role labels are coherent for re-review entry state.
2. Validate only previously-blocking requirements first (fast fail).
3. Re-evaluate unchanged governance gates from prior review.
4. Update PR Review Report verdict and evidence.
5. Post updated report and sync status label to verdict.

## Verification Steps

- Confirm blocker-specific changes are present in head branch files.
- Confirm updated verdict comment posted.
- Confirm label state matches verdict (`status:approved` or `status:changes-requested`).

## Post-Incident Follow-up

- If re-review required rebuilding context from scratch, append evidence to an `efficiency-opportunity` issue and propose a reusable checklist/template update.

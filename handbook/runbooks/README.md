# Runbooks

Store incident-style or exception workflows here (general and role-specific).

Each runbook should include:
- Scenario definition
- Immediate actions
- Decision points
- Verification steps
- Post-incident follow-up

General runbooks should be prefixed with `general-`.

Role-specific runbooks in this repo:
- `compliance-pr-review-wrapper.md`
